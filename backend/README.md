# Description
This is a website for jobs and internship that get postet on the Web Wall at the HTL.
It should make life easier for students, companies, teachers. It's main purpose is, that students can look at this wall and see the most important information for Internships for the summer, or jobs after they finished the school, or further educational opportunities like a university.

# Workflow
So this project will be created with the framework React. There are 2 repositories to this project, because we wanted to split the front and back end so that the code and structure can be cleaner.
